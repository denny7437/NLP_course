\begin{abstract}
Automatic detection of religion‑related hate speech remains a critical yet under‑explored problem. We present a new Russian‑language benchmark that combines manually curated statements (\textit{n}=198) with two large‑scale, large‑language‑model (LLM)–augmented corpora—\textsc{Delphi} and \textsc{Resonance}—totalling 4,000 labelled utterances. We compare a simple lexical rule‑based detector with a family of fine‑tuned \textsc{BERT}‑style models. Despite near‑perfect training accuracy (F$_1$=0.986), the neural model degrades sharply under domain shift, while the rule‑based classifier retains perfect out‑of‑domain performance. We analyse the causes of this brittleness and discuss hybrid strategies that inherit the efficiency of lexical rules and the coverage of transformers.

\section{Introduction}
The proliferation of hateful or extremist content online has triggered intense research into automatic content moderation. Hate speech targeting religious groups is particularly harmful because it can incite real‑world violence and violate fundamental rights\footnote{Throughout this paper we adopt the United Nations definition of ``religious hate speech.''}. While deep transformers dominate leader‑boards, recent work highlights their vulnerability to domain shift, adversarial paraphrasing and code‑mixing\cite{nasir2023cross}. Our study revisits a classical alternative: rule‑based lexicons. We ask: \emph{When the application domain is narrowly scoped and the costs of false negatives are high, can handcrafted rules outperform sophisticated neural models?}

\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Hate speech detection.} Transformer‑based classifiers such as BERT and its multilingual successors achieve state‑of‑the‑art results on standard benchmarks\cite{rethinking2025}, yet their robustness to distributional shifts is limited\cite{fair2024}. Cross‑domain studies confirm large performance drops when the evaluation corpus differs from the training source\cite{yinn2023emotion}.

\paragraph{Data augmentation with LLMs.} LLM‑driven augmentation has emerged as a powerful remedy against data scarcity\cite{ding2024augmentation}. However, few works audit whether the generated samples truly cover the lexical–pragmatic space of hateful religion‑related rhetoric.

\paragraph{Russian resources.} RuBERT and its conversational variants remain the de‑facto baselines for Russian text classification\cite{rubert}, but publicly available hate‑speech corpora in Russian are scarce and rarely focus on religion.

\section{Dataset Construction}
We start from a hand‑labelled seed set of 198 statements covering diverse religious contexts. Two augmentation pipelines were explored:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textsc{Delphi}}: prompts an LLM to generate ten contextually diverse paraphrases per seed and auto‑classifies each sample\cite{delphi};
    \item \textbf{\textsc{Resonance}}: enforces tonal homogeneity by inheriting the danger label from the seed and generating ten stylistically resonant variants\cite{resonance}.
\end{itemize}
Both subsets contain roughly 2,000 instances. We publish splits and scripts for reproducibility. Statistics are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:data}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Dataset & Size & Danger (\%) & Safe (\%) \\
\hline
Seed & 198 & 53.9 & 46.1 \\
\textsc{Delphi} & 1,980 & 51.9 & 48.1 \\
\textsc{Resonance} & 1,980 & 62.3 & 37.7 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Class distribution across corpora.}
\label{tab:data}
\end{table}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Rule‑Based Baseline}
We construct a lexicon $\Omega_{\text{dangerous}}$ of 350 n‑grams spanning explicit insults, calls to violence and sectarian slurs. A text $x$ is flagged as dangerous if $\exists \omega\in\Omega_{\text{dangerous}}:\omega\subseteq x$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:rule}).
\begin{equation}
  f_{\text{rule}}(x)=\begin{cases}1,&\text{if }\exists\omega\subseteq x\\ 0,&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}
  \label{eq:rule}
\end{equation}
The implementation runs in $\mathcal{O}(n m)$ where $n$ is the token count and $m=|\Omega_{\text{dangerous}}|$.

\subsection{Transformer Models}
We fine‑tune the 180M‑parameter \texttt{DeepPavlov/rubert-base-cased} model with weighted cross‑entropy to address class imbalance. Hyper‑parameters follow a cosine‑annealing schedule with mixed‑precision training on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.

\section{Experiments}
We evaluate on the held‑out seed test set (160 samples) and measure Accuracy and macro F$_1$. Results are reported in Table~\ref{tab:results}.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\hline
Model & Train Acc & Test Acc & F$_1$ \\ \hline
Rule‑Based & 1.000 & 1.000 & 1.000 \\
BERT v1 & 0.575 & 0.575 & -- \\
BERT v2 & 0.990 & 0.706 & -- \\
BERT v3 & 0.986 & 0.706 & 0.706 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance comparison.}
\label{tab:results}
\end{table}

\section{Domain Shift Analysis}
Let $P_{\text{train}}(X)$ and $P_{\text{test}}(X)$ denote the marginal distributions of features. The rule‑based model relies on pattern matching and is agnostic to $P(X)$, whereas BERT implicitly learns priors from token co‑occurrences; when $P_{\text{train}}(X)\neq P_{\text{test}}(X)$ the softmax outputs become mis‑calibrated, echoing findings by Yin and Gauch\cite{yinn2023emotion}.

\section{Discussion}
Our results corroborate prior reports of transformers' brittleness under cross‑domain evaluation\cite{nasir2023cross}. Within a narrowly defined topic and language, lexical rules offer transparent and regulation‑friendly moderation. However, they fail to capture novel neologisms. A pragmatic route is an ensemble wherein rules act as high‑precision filters and neural models handle ambiguous cases, as advocated in multi‑modal moderation research\cite{mhsdf2025}.

\section{Conclusion}
We release the first openly available Russian dataset focusing on religious hate speech and show that, under domain shift, a simple rule‑based approach dominates larger neural networks. Future work will extend coverage to multimodal inputs and investigate adversarial robustness.
